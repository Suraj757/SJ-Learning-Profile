## üîß **Demo Troubleshooting**

### **If Database Issues:**
- The app is designed to work **without a database** for demo purposes
- Assessment will complete and show results even if database save fails
- Teacher assignment tracking may not persist between sessions

### **If Assignment Link Doesn't Work:**
- Try copying the full URL including the `?token=` parameter
- Make sure you're pasting it in a new browser tab/window
- The token is case-sensitive

### **For Multiple Demos:**
- Use different student names for each demo
- Clear browser cache between demos if needed
- Teacher accounts persist, so you can reuse "Ms. Johnson"
